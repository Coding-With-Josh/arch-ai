## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Start a Project**  
   Users create or join an organization and start a project from scratch or from a template.

2. **Design & Flow**  
   Build your frontend visually in **Design View**, and connect logic in **Flow View** using smart contract blocks, API routes, and database calls.

3. **Connect Smart Contracts**  
   Easily integrate with Solana programs using prebuilt contract modules or custom calls. Supports compressed accounts for efficient state handling.

4. **Deploy**  
   One-click deployment of dApps to Solana testnet/mainnet. Frontends can also be deployed to Vercel, Lit Protocol, or Fleek.

5. **Earn or Extend**  
   Share your components, flows, or templates in the marketplace to earn tokens. Purchase premium tools and plugins using $ARCH.

## 🧱 Compressed Assets

Arch uses **compressed NFTs** and **compressed accounts** to store:
- UI metadata and design components
- Versioned flows and templates
- Project deployment states

This ensures fast, low-cost, scalable on-chain storage and keeps the platform efficient for builders at scale.
